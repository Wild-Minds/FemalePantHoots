Abstract
An interplay between physiological and social factors drives vocal communication in complex, dynamic animal societies. Chimpanzee pant-hoots are frequently-produced long-distance vocalisations encoding varied information and used to mediate social interactions. However, despite important physiological and social differences between male and female chimpanzees, pant-hoot research has traditionally focused on males, with little known about female use. To investigate how females' unique physiological and social characteristics might affect pant-hoot use, we collected all-occurrence behavioural data from focal follows of wild Eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) in two communities in the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda. We recorded pant-hoots produced and received by mature males and females, as well as the social context (e.g., activity, party composition) and individual factors (e.g., sex, parity, oestrus). Females pant-hooted less frequently than males, even when controlling for the number of opportunities to respond. Some factors predicted pant-hooting in response for males and females equally: chimpanzees were more likely to pant-hoot in response when hearing a call from their party. Other factors varied with sex: both males and females were less likely to produce pant-hoot responses as their party size increased, but this effect was stronger for males. Alpha male presence in the party decreased male chimpanzeesâ€™ likelihood of pant-hooting in response, but had no impact on female likelihood to respond. Female chimpanzees were less likely to respond to pant-hoots when in maximal oestrous. Most results were consistent across females in the two neighbouring communities; however, Waibira females were more likely than Sonso to respond with increasing party size. Our findings suggest pant-hoots are sensitive to individual and social factors in both female and male chimpanzees and are sometimes used in sex-specific ways, supporting the idea that pant-hoots are an important and flexible element of chimpanzee vocal behaviour and are central to communication in both sexes.
